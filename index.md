# Goals of the network
The Hardware Acceleration Network NL is a platform to connect Dutch researchers and professionals focused on computer hardware acceleration, a relatively new field that is growing fast in importance both from a research as well as industrial perspective. Our goal is to bring together partners interested in hardware acceleration in the Netherlands and be able to exchange ideas, experiences, spark interest in the field, and define collaborations between universities and with the industry. 

# Organizing activities
Our network organizes activities to engender collaborations, and out reach to both organizations as well as interested individuals, both professionals and students, active in the field. We organize a number of activities such as workshops to discuss activities of partners, and seminars to present the state-of-the-art in the field. Here are some more examples of our activities:
- Organize seminars to present new research
- Organize hands-on workshops
- Plan research collaborations
- Show proof-of-concepts/demonstrators
- Execute joint experiments or short projects
- Organize hackathons
